# Build Exercise

Requires:
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)
* [CMAKE](https://cmake.org/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

learning about git submodules and build scripts. i should've probably just used 1 scripting language instead having both batch and python. but batch scripting is not fun, so i threw some python in there.

a batch script will take care of building the dependency, and then python will take care of everything else when the project is built.

## Remember to do a recursive clone to get submodules.
